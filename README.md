# Sudoku Solver

Currently this has logic that makes is specific to solving Sudoku puzzles. It works, and can solve a decent amount of puzzles, however, there are some it does not get due to requiring slightly difficult reasoning. I hope to make it a little more generalized eventually, but we shall see.

## ToDo

- Add some specialized logic to see if even very hard Sudokus can be solved
- Try to find more general solution to Sudoku puzzle solving
- Generalize project to more easily work with other constraints and cell values
